These files are my journey into web-scraping. My main goal was to get as much data as I could for every NFL player; this meant going to various 
websites and pulling that data. I started with BeautifulSoup which did a lot of the heavy lifting but there were instances where I needed to use a 
search engine to get to the next stage. I was having trouble until I discovered Selenium, this allowed me to expand my project and I plan to continue 
this expansion by including data analytics and webpage capabilities.
